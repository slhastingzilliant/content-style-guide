If you write, edit, or review customer-facing content for Zilliant documentation or applications, this guide is for you.

## Using this guide

This is the Zilliant technical content style guide. It helps us write clear and consistent content for applications and product documentation.

We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish. The entire guide is searchable.

## Resources

Zilliant style starts with the standard guidelines in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/" target="_blank">Microsoft Writing Style Guide</a>. 
We've developed our voice, tone, and standards based on our preferences, or to match the unique characteristics of our business.

When developing content, we often reference the following style and architecture guides:
