If you write, edit, or review customer-facing content for Zilliant documentation or applications, this guide is for you.

## Using this guide

This is the Zilliant technical content style guide. It helps us write clear and consistent content for applications and product documentation.

Weâ€™ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish. The entire guide is searchable.

## Resources

Zilliant style starts with the standard guidelines in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/" target="_blank">Microsoft Writing Style Guide</a>. 
We've developed our voice, tone, and standards based on our preferences, or to match the unique characteristics of our business.

## Credits

We adapted this guide from the [Mailchimp Content Style Guide on GitHub](https://github.com/mailchimp/content-style-guide). We gratefully acknowledge their openly sharing their guidelines and work. We are better writers and content developers as a result.
